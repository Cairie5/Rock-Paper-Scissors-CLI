# import random: This line imports the Python random module, which is used to generate random choices for the computer.

# play_round(player_choice): This function simulates a single round of the game. It takes the player's choice as an argument.

# choices = ['rock', 'paper', 'scissors']: This is a list containing the possible choices in the game.

# computer_choice = random.choice(choices): This line randomly selects a choice from the choices list as the computer's choice.

# The if and elif statements compare the player's choice to the computer's choice to determine the round's result. If the choices are the same, it's a tie. Otherwise, it checks if the player's choice beats the computer's choice based on the rules of the game.

# get_computer_choice(): This function simply returns a random choice for the computer from the choices list.
